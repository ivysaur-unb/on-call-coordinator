DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:something@localhost:42333/oncall"

# "myuser" - must be a database user with permission to create databases
# By default the user created with the MARIADB_USER environment variable does not have these permissions
# You will either have to update user permissions through a SQL call or use "root" user

# The port we are using is 42333 because that is the port mapped to port 3306 (default mysql/mariadb port) on the docker container
